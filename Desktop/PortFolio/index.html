   <p>Hello! I’m Charles Njoroge

    I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for building robust and scalable web applications. With a degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience in both frontend and backend technologies, I thrive on transforming ideas into functional software solutions.
    
    My technical expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Vue.js for frontend development. On the backend, I’m proficient in Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and delivering high-quality, user-friendly products.
    
    When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or engaging in community tech events. I draw inspiration from both the digital world and my surroundings, which fuels my creativity in every project I take on.
    
    I’m excited to connect with other developers and explore new opportunities in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out or check out my projects below!
